# Affective Agent
This work is based on R. Hodson's thesis, in which he developed a simple environment in which an Active Inference / Reinforcement Learning agent needs to act to fulfill its own needs. It does this by moving around in the environment and finding food, water, etc. Please refer to his thesis for full details.

The main, initial contribution of this repository is to refactor the code and rewrite it in Python. This should make experimentation much easier than the existing MATLAB implementation.
